abstract: ' Object classification is a key element that enables effective decision-making
  in many autonomous systems. A more sophisticated system may also utilize the probability
  distribution over the classes instead of basing its decision only on the most likely
  class. This paper introduces a new performance metric for evaluating the accuracy
  of such probabilities. We test this metric using different neural network architectures
  and datasets. Furthermore, we present a new task-based neural network for object
  classification and compare its performance with a typical probabilistic classification
  model to show the improvement with threshold-based probabilistic decision-making.'
