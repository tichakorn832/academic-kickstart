abstract: "This paper describes an autonomous vehicle testbed that aims at providing the first- and last- mile transportation services. The vehicle mainly operates in a crowded urban environment whose features can be extracted a priori. To ensure that the system is economically feasible, we take a minimalistic approach and exploit prior knowledge of the environment and the availability of the existing infrastructure such as cellular networks and traffic cameras. We present three main components of the system: pedestrian detection, localization (even in the presence of tall buildings) and navigation. The performance of each component is evaluated. Finally, we describe the role of the existing infrastructural sensors and show the improved performance of the system when they are utilized."
