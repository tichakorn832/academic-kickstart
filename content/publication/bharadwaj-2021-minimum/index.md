abstract: Urban air mobility (UAM) refers to air transportation services in and over
  an urban area and has the potential to revolutionize mobility solutions. However,
  due to the projected scale of operations, current air traffic management (ATM) techniques
  are not viable. Autonomous systems leveraging AI techniques are a pathway to accelerate
  the realization of UAM operations, but must be fielded safely and efficiently. The
  heavily regulated, safety critical nature of aviation may lead to multiple, competing
  safety constraints. In this paper, we design a framework which allows for the scalable
  planning of a UAM ATM system. We formalize safety oriented constraints derived from
  FAA regulations by encoding them as temporal logic formulae. We then propose a method
  for autonomous UAM ATM that is both scalable and minimally violates the temporal
  logic constraints. Numerical results show that the runtime for our proposed algorithm
  is suitable for very large problems and is backed by theoretical guarantees of correctness
  with respect to given temporal logic constraints.
