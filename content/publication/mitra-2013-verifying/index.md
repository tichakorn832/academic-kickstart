abstract: "Safety-compromising bugs in software-controlled systems are often hard to detect. In a 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge vehicle, such a defect remained hidden during more than 300 miles of test-driving, manifesting for the first time during the competition. With this incident as an example, the authors discuss formalisms and techniques available for safety analysis of cyber-physical systems."
