abstract: "A  case  study  of  the  Singapore  road  network  provides  empirical  evi-dence that road pricing can significantly affect commuter trip timing be-haviors.  In this paper, we propose a model of trip timing decisions thatreasonably matches the observed commuters’ behaviors.  Our model ex-plicitly captures the difference in individuals’ sensitivity to price, traveltime  and  early  or  late  arrival  at  destination.   New  pricing  schemes  aresuggested to better spread peak travel and reduce traffic congestion.  Sim-ulation results based on the proposed model are provided in comparisonwith the real data for the Singapore case study."
