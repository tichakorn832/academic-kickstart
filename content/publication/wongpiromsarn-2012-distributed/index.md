abstract: "We propose a distributed algorithm for controlling traffic signals. Our algorithm is adapted from backpressure routing, which has been mainly applied to communication and power networks. We formally prove that our algorithm ensures global optimality as it leads to maximum network throughput even though the controller is constructed and implemented in a completely distributed manner. Simulation results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms SCATS, an adaptive traffic signal control system that is being used in many cities."
