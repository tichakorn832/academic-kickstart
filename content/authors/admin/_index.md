I am an assistant professor in the <a href='https://www.cs.iastate.edu'>Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href='https://www.iastate.edu/'>Iowa State University</a>. I received a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 2010, where my advisor was <a href='http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/wiki/Main_Page'>Prof. Richard Murray</a>. My research interest lies in the broad area of formal methods, motion planning, control, and optimization, with particular focus on specification, design, and analysis of cyber-physical systems and situational reasoning and decision making in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Most of my work draws inspiration from practical applications, especially in autonomous systems, robotics, and transportation.

Prior to joining ISU, I was a principal research scientist at <a href='https://www.aptiv.com/solutions/autonomous-mobility'>nuTonomy</a> (now <a href='https://hyundai-aptivad.com/'>Hyundai-Aptiv Autonomous Driving Joint Venture</a>), where I led the planning team. As one of the earliest employees, I was heavily involved in the whole software development and release process, from design (interfaces and modules) to implementation (C++ and python), testing, evaluation, and deployment. My work focused on planning, decision making, control, behavior specification, and validation of autonomous vehicles. I was also involved in the <a href='https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/darpa-urban-challenge'>DARPA Urban Challenge</a>, where I led the Systems team for Team Caltech during my Ph.D.
