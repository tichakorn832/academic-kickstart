This project involves building an autonomous ground vehicle capable of maneuvering a 60 mile course in a mock urban environment in less than 6 hours. As the coordinator of the Systems team, my contribution to this project is the development of a new software architecture for distributed goal and contingency management which is the main part of the mission management subsystem. I have also implemented the decision making logic of the planning module.
